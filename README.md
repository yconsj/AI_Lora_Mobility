# AI_Lora_Mobility
This project contains all files related to investigating the use of AI (reinforcement learning) for LoRa Mobility using OMNET++. The python directories are meant to use an excel file shared between the simulation and python scripts used for leaning. After each simulation the python script will update the excel file which contains parameters for the simulator.
